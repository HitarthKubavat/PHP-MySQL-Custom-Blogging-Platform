# PHP-MySQL-Custom-Blogging-Platform

This repository contains a full-stack, custom-built Blogging Platform developed using PHP for server-side logic and MySQL for persistent data storage. The project is designed to be a comprehensive demonstration of building a dynamic, data-driven web application from the ground up, without relying on external CMS frameworks. It features a complete User Management System that allows visitors to register for an account, securely log in, and log out. Once authenticated, users gain access to a personal dashboard where they can exercise full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality over their own blog posts, making it a robust, multi-user content creation system. This project is ideal for showcasing fundamental skills in database interaction, secure session management, and MVC-like architecture in pure PHP.
